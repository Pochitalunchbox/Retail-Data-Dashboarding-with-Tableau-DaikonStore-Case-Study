## üíº Problem Context

Retail businesses operate in competitive and fragmented markets. Executives and analysts need a clear understanding of:
- Which customer segments generate the most revenue?
- Which products drive profitability vs. just volume?
- Which regions and shipping methods boost‚Äîor hinder‚Äîmargins?

This project provides a structured visual answer to these questions using data from **51,000+ customers** and thousands of product orders.

- **Total Customers Analyzed**: 51,228
- **Top Market**: APAC (28.35% of global sales)

- **Key Insight**: Consumer segment drives over 50% of revenue. Profitability is tied to subcategories and shipping methods, not just sales volume.
